# Civity REST client

Java library for doing HTTP requests to and from HTTP server. The library acts as a wrapper around the Apache HTTP components library and allows us to create new implementations should this library be replaced for whatever reason.

`
cd <directory_where_you_want_to_clone>
git clone https://github.com/CivityNL/SCOREwater-Java.git
