# Turbinator database scripts

This folder contains the scripts to set up the Turbinator database. Run the scripts in the order as indicated by the filename. The script to create the turbinator user and database must be run as administrator, the other ones can be run by the turbinator user created in the first script. Each script contains a header with an example on how to run it using the psql command line tool. You might have to change some of the parameters (for instance the host name) depending on your set-up. The password can be provided using the PGPASSWORD command line option, but it can also be entered when prompted by the psql command. The scripts can also be run using for instance [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/).
